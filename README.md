# GoAnimate-Business-Friendly-Props

Update 2022: This hasen't been touched in months. I may bring it back but its pointless because the latest version of wrapper has business friendly already

--THIS WILL BE UPDATED SOON---


This allows you to use business friendly on pretty much any version of the GA legacy video maker! (wrapper) 

Note: only props work for now. Characters and backgrounds don't work

# To use:

1. place the business folder in: C:\Users\[Your Directory Here]\Wrapper-Offline\server\store\3a981f5cb2739137
2. Place the themelist.xml file in: C:\Users\[Your Directory Here]\Wrapper-Offline\wrapper\_THEMES
3. place the business.xml file in: C:\Users\[Your Directory Here]\Wrapper-Offline\wrapper\_THEMES
4. Start Wrapper: Offline
